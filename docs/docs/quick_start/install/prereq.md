# Prerequisites

## Kubernetes

- Kubernetes `1.18+`
- CoreDNS is deployed

### Unsupported platforms

1. OpenShift
2. Rancher

:::note
Above platforms are not supported currently but will be in the future.
:::

## Hosts

### Linux distributions

1. CentOS/RHEL `7.4+`
2. Rocky Linux `8.4+`
3. Ubuntu `18+`
4. Kylin `V10`

### Processor architecture

1. x86_64
2. ARM64

### Package dependencies

1. `LVM2` is installed.
2. For HA features, `kernel-devel` shall be installed and has a compatible version with the current `kernel`.
3. For VolumeResize features, a tool to resize the filesystem is required. 
   By default, `xfs` is used as the volume filesystem. Therefore, you need to install `xfs_growfs` on the host.


```console title="CentOS/RHEL, Rocky and Kylin"
$ yum install -y lvm2
$ yum install -y kernel-devel-$(uname -r)
$ yum install -y xfsprogs
```

```console title="Ubuntu"
$ apt-get install -y lvm2
$ apt-get install -y linux-headers-$(uname -r)
$ apt-get install -y xfsprogs
```

### Secure Boot

The HA feature does not support `Secure Boot` currently. Make sure `Secure Boot` is `disabled`ï¼š

```console
$ mokutil --sb-state
SecureBoot disabled

$ dmesg | grep secureboot
[    0.000000] secureboot: Secure boot disabled
```

### Data disks

HwameiStor supports `HDD`, `SSD`, and `NVMe`.

For test, each host must have at least one unused drive with a minimal size of `10GiB`.

For production, it is recommended to have at least one unused drive, protected by RAID1 or RAID5/6, with a minimal size of `200GiB`.

:::note
For virtual machine environments, please ensure that the disk serial number feature is enabled for each virtual machine. This will assist HwameiStor in better identifying and managing the disks on the host.

To avoid disk identification conflicts, please ensure that the provided virtual disk serial numbers are not duplicated.
:::

### Network

For production, it is recommended to have a redundant `10Giga TCP/IP` network, if the HA feature is enabled.
