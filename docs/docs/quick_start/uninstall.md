# Uninstallation (For test purpose, not use for production)

To ensure data security, it is strongly recommended not to uninstall the HwameiStor system in a production environment.
This section introduces two uninstallation scenarios for testing environments.

## Uninstall but retain data volumes

If you want to uninstall the HwameiStor components, but still keep the existing data volumes working with the applications, perform the following steps:

```console
$ kubectl get cluster.hwameistor.io
NAME             AGE
cluster-sample   21m

$ kubectl delete clusters.hwameistor.io  hwameistor-cluster
```

Finally, all the HwameiStor's components (i.e. Pods) will be deleted. Check by:

```console
$ kubectl -n hwameistor get pod
```

## Uninstall and delete data volumes

   2. Delete hwameistor namespace.

      ```console
      kubectl delete ns hwameistor
      ```

   3. Delete CRD, Hook, and RBAC.

      ```bash
      kubectl get crd,mutatingwebhookconfiguration,clusterrolebinding,clusterrole -o name \
        | grep hwameistor \
        | xargs -t kubectl delete
      ```

   4. Delete StorageClass.

      ```bash
      kubectl get sc -o name \
        | grep hwameistor-storage-lvm- \
        | xargs -t kubectl delete
      ```

   5. Delete hwameistor-operator.

      ```bash
      helm uninstall hwameistor-operator -n hwameistor
      ```

3. Finally, you still need to clean up the LVM configuration on each node, and also data on the disks by tools like `wipefs`.

   ```bash
   wipefs -a /dev/sdx
   blkid /dev/sdx
   ```
